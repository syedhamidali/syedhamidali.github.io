### Overview
Welcome to this interactive tutorial on creating custom colormaps. By the end of this post, you'll be able to design your own colormaps effortlessly by manipulating RGB lines according to your preferences.

### Step 1: Design Your Colormap
1. Visit https://syedha.com/colormaps.
2. Use the interactive tool to drag the RGB lines until you achieve your desired colormap.

### Step 2: Copy Your Colormap
1. In the 'Copy Your Colormap' section, select the option to copy the colormap as plain text.
2. Click the 'Copy' button to copy the colormap matrix to your clipboard.

### Step 3: Apply Your Colormap
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment.
2. Run the following code while the copied matrix is still in your clipboard:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib as mpl
import numpy as np

def create_colorbar_from_clipboard():
    df = pd.read_clipboard(header=None)
    df.columns = ['R', 'G', 'B']
    c = np.array(df/255.0)
    cm = mpl.colors.ListedColormap(c)
    return cm

cmap = create_colorbar_from_clipboard()
cmap
```
