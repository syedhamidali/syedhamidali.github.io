Hello and welcome to my profile! I am an atmospheric science enthusiast, driven by a deep-seated passion for understanding and predicting weather and climate patterns. My pursuit of this goal has led me to explore a diverse range of topics, from machine learning tools to meteorological data analysis and beyond.

As part of my journey, I have pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Kashmir](https://www.kashmiruniversity.net/){:target="_blank"} and a Master’s degree in Atmospheric Science from [Savitribai Phule Pune University](https://www.unipune.ac.in){:target="_blank"} and [Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology](https://tropmet.res.in){:target="_blank"} (IITM), Pune. During my time at IITM Pune, I worked on developing radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation techniques for my dissertation under the guidance of [Dr. M.C.R. Kalapureddy](https://www.tropmet.res.in/106-Madhu%20Chandra%20R.%20Kalapureddy-scientist_detail){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Kishore K. Grandhi]( https://uohyd.irins.org/profile/344518){:target="_blank"}. I have been actively developing and contributing to open-source Pythonic softwares such as [PyScanCf](https://syedha.com/PyScanCf/){:target="_blank"}, [Radarx](https://radarx.rtfd.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Xradar](https://xradar.rtfd.io/){:target="_blank"},{:target="_blank"}, [Py-ART](https://arm-doe.github.io/pyart/){:target="_blank"},  [PyDDA](https://openradarscience.org/PyDDA/){:target="_blank"}, etc.

Currently, I am a Grad Research Assistant in the [Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences](https://eaps.purdue.edu){:target="_blank"}, [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu){:target="_blank"}, where I have the privilege of working under the expert guidance of Prof. Dr. Daniel T. Dawson, and Prof. Dr. Robin Tanamachi. My research is focused on [Quasilinear Convective Systems]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squall_line){:target="_blank"}, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the accuracy of short-range numerical predictions for severe convective storms and their associated hazards.

With every new challenge and project, I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skills, and I believe that my passion for atmospheric sciences will continue to inspire me throughout my academic and professional journey. Thank you for taking the time to read my profile, and I look forward to connecting with others who share my passion for meteorology and the natural world.
